Analyzing Customer Churn Behavior


ðŸš€ Project Objective
I embarked on this venture with the aim of crafting a nuanced customer retention program, capitalizing on data analysis to foresee and understand customer churn behavior.

ðŸš€ Dataset
I utilized an insightful dataset courtesy of IBM, incorporating a myriad of customer attributes - demographic details, account information, and the range of services used. My focus was to delve deep into this dataset to extract insights into customer churn tendencies.

ðŸš€ Pre-Processing
Initiating my journey with data cleansing and preparation, I meticulously converted object values to integers and addressed missing values, crafting a strong foundation for the subsequent stages of model training.

ðŸš€ Visualization
I devised potent visualizations to decipher the underlying patterns between customer tenure, monthly charges, and their propensity to churn. This pivotal step empowered me to understand the prevalent trends and establish a solid groundwork for my predictive model.

ðŸš€ Feature Engineering
Taking a leap into feature engineering, I employed One-Hot-Encoding to metamorphose categorical data into a format conducive for machine learning algorithms. Moreover, I implemented scaling techniques to normalize feature values, a strategy aimed at bolstering the performance of my model.

ðŸš€ Model Development
I assembled a deep learning model with the robust frameworks of TensorFlow and Keras. This neural network, fortified with three layers, was trained to pinpoint potential churn signals, building upon the features identified earlier.

ðŸš€ Training and Testing
To authenticate the efficacy of my model, I segregated the data into training and testing subsets. This strategy was instrumental in mitigating overfitting and fostering a model capable of adeptly handling unseen data.

ðŸš€ Results
I trained my model assiduously over 100 epochs, and it exhibited an encouraging aptitude in accurately predicting customer churn.

ðŸš€ Reflections
I polished my expertise in managing and refining complex datasets.
I deepened my understanding of customer behavior nuances through data visualization.
I fine-tuned my ability to forge predictive models utilizing deep learning technologies.
